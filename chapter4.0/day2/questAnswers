.link() is used when we want to make a resource publically accessible. The function takes in 2 parameters: the /public/ or /private/ path and a target: that is a /storage/ path where the linked data lives. 'Linking' something to a /public/ or /private/ path is creating capabilities that we can also use to retrict access to certain parts of our resource we do not want available to the public.

We can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the /public/ path by creating a new resource interface inside our contract that only contains the fields we want publically accessible. When we 'link' our resource to the /public/ path, we can restrict that interface and have the resource implement the resource interface that only has what we want in it exposed. It will result in an error if we try to access the entire reference in a script.
