There are a varitety of different blockchains. A blockchain is a decentralized database that stores information and is open for anyone to view and interact with. The data entered is secure and irreversible. For example, the blockchain is used for history of transactions that will be permanently recorded and viewable to the public.
Smart contracts are developer created programs that are deployed to specify functionality in order for people to interact with it. Smart contracts can be seen as a secure agreement that guarantees the outcome for all participants. Important to note, it is the developer's responsibility to ensure there are no security flaws. Without a middleman or need for third party approval, this process is quick and efficient.
The main differences between a transaction and a script are cost and ability to change and view data on the blockchain. A transaction is a paid function that changes data on the blockchain. A script only allows data to be viewed, not changed, and is always free.
