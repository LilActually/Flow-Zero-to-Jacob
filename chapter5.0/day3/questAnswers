Force casting using the 'as!' syntax takes a generic type and makes it more specific. Making the type more specific ensures that we can only deposit the specific NFT type we want into our collection, otherwise any other Flow project would technically be able to deposit their own NFT type into our Collection if they were to use the same original generic type we "downcasted".

The auth keyword is an "authorized reference" that would be used in a situation when we want to return a reference using the borrow function, but the type we want to reference is not exposing all of the metadata fields we want to read. In order to "downcast" that type to the more specific type we want using the 'as!' syntax, we have to use an auth reference. If the reference does not return the type we specified, it will panic.
