Standards can be very beneficial to the Flow ecostystem by keeping a consistency across specific types of contracts such as NFT contracts. Clients like a decentralized marketplace might have a large amount of contracts and standards keep the fuctionality consistent for every NFT contract; this could help the ecosystem by attracting potential clients and maintaining current clients who prefer the efficiency of having a singular way to interact with all contracts rather than implementing them all individually.
