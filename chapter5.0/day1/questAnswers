An event is a way for a smart contract to communicate and relay real-time information to the blockchain when an action takes place. This is helpful to a client so their code can be updated accordingly when an NFT is minted. Events can also conveniently tell us the total supply instead of relying strictly on the contract itself.

Function numberOne: will log the name 'Jacob' because the length = 5.
Function numberTwo: will return a value. In the pre-condition, 'Jacob' is greater than 0. In the post-condition, name.concat("Tucker") will string together Jacob and Tucker resulting in 'Jacob Tucker'.
Function numberThree: will not log the updated number. self.number = 0, self.number will try to return a 1 because self.number=self.number+1. In the post-condition, before(self.number)=result+1 will want the result to be 2. It will then panic and self.number will be reverted back to 0.
